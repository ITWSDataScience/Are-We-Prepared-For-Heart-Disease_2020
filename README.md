# Are We Pepared For Heart Disease?
By: Angelina Martineau, Vaishnavi Neema, and Andrew Updegrove
## Abstract
Heart Disease, also known as Cardiovascular Disease, is the leading cause of death in the United States. According to the CDC, someone in the United States dies every 36 seconds from heart disease (cdc.gov, 2020). The cost of heart disease reaches hundreds of billions of dollars every year.

Due to the prevalence of heart disease in the United States, it is important that healthcare and health insurance companies be prepared to handle the amount of treatment required. It is of particular importance to understand where healthcare and health insurance are lacking, especially if these locations correlate with high levels of heart disease.

This project aims to highlight the areas where heart disease is more prevalent and health insurance or healthcare is not as prevalent.
## Data
Five data sets were used to complete this project:
Heart Disease Dataset
Hospital Bed Availability Dataset
Health Insurance Dataset
Population by County Dataset
State Code Dataset
The heart disease, hospital bed availability, and health insurance datasets are all broken down by county. This led to the inclusion of the population by county dataset, which allowed the results of the analysis to be normalized by population. Finally, the state code dataset was used, which contains the 2-digit state FIPS code. All datasets were obtained in CSV format, and the metadata collected for each dataset was maintained in the GitHub repository for this project. The newly created data is also included in this repository, with the appropriate provenance and metadata information.
